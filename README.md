## üíª What's DBledus?
DBledus is a program designed to measure and visualize the user's voice level in real-time, providing a clear and easy-to-interpret indicator on a scale from 0 to 100. Its main purpose is to assist in situations where the user is speaking while gaming, such as in video game sessions, where the use of headphones and immersion in the game make it difficult to perceive the actual volume of the voice.

When you're focused on the game, it can be hard to hear your own voice through the headphones, which may cause you to speak too loudly without realizing it. In these cases, DBledus acts as a real-time monitor, showing you a visual level of your voice so you can adjust the volume and avoid disturbing others, like family members or fellow gamers.

The minimized mode allows you to control your voice level at all times without cluttering the screen, and the size of the bar is customizable.

This program is especially useful at night when you want to keep your voice low to avoid waking anyone up or causing disturbances, or in situations where you‚Äôre gaming in shared spaces, like rooms or apartments. Thanks to its precise and continuous measurement, it helps maintain an appropriate tone without exceeding it, ensuring that your voice remains clear and understandable without being intrusive.

It‚Äôs ideal for moments when you need perfect volume control, such as during video calls, recordings, or interacting with others while gaming. With its intuitive interface, you can adjust your voice volume without interrupting your gaming experience, making it a perfect tool for gamers and anyone who wants to maintain an appropriate tone without bothering others.



## üéØ Program features
- **Real-time measurement**. <br>
The program uses the device's microphone to capture the user's voice level and display it accurately on a scale from 0 to 100.

- **Overlay visual graph**. <br>
It offers the possibility of visualizing a small graph of the voice level, which can be configured to always remain on top of the screen. This ensures that the user can monitor their volume without interruptions, even while using other applications.

- **Adjustable sensitivity**. <br>
It allows modification of the microphone's sensitivity to adapt to different voice tones or ambient noise levels.

- **Configurable size**. <br>
The graph in minimized mode can be resized to better integrate into the user's workflow.


## ‚è¨ How to download

<br>

- ‚ñ∂ **"Start" button:** <br>
Use this button to start capturing and mapping audio.

- üîß **"Settings" button:** <br>
Access advanced configurations needed to customize the program's behavior. Details about these options are described further below.

- ‚èπ **"Stop" button:** <br>
This button will be enabled once the program starts capturing audio. Use it to stop the audio capture and access the settings menu if modifications are needed.

- üëÅ‚Äçüó® **"Minimize" button:** <br>
In the top-right corner, you‚Äôll find an option to minimize the graphical display, preventing it from interfering with the rest of the screen. First, move the main window to the desired location and then press the minimize button. In this mode, the graph will remain visible as an overlay on other programs. To restore it to its original size, simply press the same button again.

<br>

- üì∂ **Bar dimensions in minimized mode:** <br>
Located on the left side, this option allows you to adjust the size of the graph when in minimized mode, optimizing its visibility and functionality according to your preferences.

- üîâ **Audio sensitivity section:** <br>
This option allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the audio capture, adapting it to various environments and sound levels to achieve greater accuracy in the results:

   ‚û° *Reduce* the value if you want to increase sensitivity to noise, which will make it easier to detect peaks with lower voice tones, but it will avoid capturing higher tones.

   ‚û° *Increase* the value if you prefer to decrease the sensitivity, allowing you to speak more loudly without easily detecting the peaks.

- ‚úÖ **"Confirm" Button:** <br> 
To save and apply the changes made, press the button. If you decide not to save the adjustments, simply close the window by pressing the Close (X) button; in this case, the changes will not take effect, and the previous settings will be retained.
